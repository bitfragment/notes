The mandate of symbolic logic: beyond science
---------------------------------------------

> Symbolic logic  is an instrument of exact thought, both analytic and constructive; its mission, accordingly, is not only to validate scientific methods, but also to clarify the semantic confusions that beset the popular mind as well as the professional philosopher at the present time. "Semantics" (blessed word!) is in dire need of responsible analysis and skillful handling, and symbolic logic is the most effective preparation I can think of for a frontal attack on the pathetic muddles of modern philosophical thought. It blasts natural misconceptions with every move, not by a process of "debunking," but by purposeful and lucid constructions of ideas. (7)


What all branches of logic have in common
-----------------------------------------

> To a novice, it is hard to see what are the aims, principles, and procedures of logic *per se,* and what relations with several branches bear to it and to each other. Underlying them all is the principle of *generality* which culminates in the attainment of *abstractions.* The several branches of logic are so many *studies in generalization.* the aims of logical research may very put the interests of different investigators [â€¦] But the procedure is everywhere the same: it is progressive systematization and generalization. Likewise, the criterion of success is the same: is the discovery of *abstract forms.* (17)
