[Incomplete: includes only remarks on Holberton's Sort-Merge Generator]

*Early work in "automatic coding": Betty Holberton's Sort-Merge Generator.* The S-MG was "the first step to tell us that that we could actually use a computer to write programs" (9). It took a specification for data files and generated routines for sorting and merging. "[I]t contained, I think, what I would define as the first version of a virtual memory in that it made use of overlays automatically without being told to by the programmer. I think that meant a great deal to me. It meant that I could do these things automatically; that you could make a computer write a program" (9).
