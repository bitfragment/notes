Defining a program as a string of characters
--------------------------------------------

"A conventional computer program is a long string of characters" [@stuart_understanding_2013, 19]. 

A specification of the language's syntax provides rules for the validity of such strings of characters, as legible to a human reader, on the one hand, and to a parser, on the other [@stuart_understanding_2013, 19].


As both instructions and data
-----------------------------

"Programs live a double life" [@stuart_understanding_2013, 258]: they are both instructions (code) and data, and it is this double life that "makes software possible in the first place" [@stuart_understanding_2013, 258]. Some languages (e.g. Lisp languages) are "explicitly written as data structures that the language itself can manipulate" [@stuart_understanding_2013, 258].
