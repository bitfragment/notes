From [Historic Documents in Computer Science, collected by Karl Kleine](http://www.fh-jena.de/~kleine/history/):

* [Fortran Automated Coding System For the IBM 704](http://www.fh-jena.de/~kleine/history/languages/FortranAutomaticCodingSystemForTheIBM704.pdf): 
the very first Fortran manual, by John Backus, et al., Oct. 1956  [Al Kossow](http://www.spies.com/~aek) has in his [manual collection](http://www.bitsavers.org/pdf) also an [ IBM 704 manual](http://www.bitsavers.org/pdf/ibm/704/24-6661-2_704_Manual_1955.pdf), if you want to have a look at the machine that this original Fortran language was made for. Also the next IBM manuals are from the collection at his web site, where you can find a number of Fortran manuals, for many machines of various manufacturers.

* The [FORTRAN II General Information Manual](http://www.fh-jena.de/~kleine/history/languages/F28-8074-3_FORTRANII_GenInf.pdf) and
[ IBM 7090/7094 Programming Systems: FORTRAN II Programming](http://www.fh-jena.de/~kleine/history/languages/C28-6054-4_7090_FORTRANII.pdf)
are two IBM manuals of 1963 describing the FORTRAN II language.

* [IBM 7090/7094 Programming Systems: FORTRAN IV Language](http://www.fh-jena.de/~kleine/history/languages/C28-6274-1_7090_FORTRANIV.pdf), 1963, and

* [IBM System 360 and System 370 FORTRAN IV Language](http://www.fh-jena.de/~kleine/history/languages/GC28-6515-10-FORTRAN-IV-Language.pdf), 1974.
FORTRAN IV was next to the ANSI standard of 1966 for long time the reference language for Fortran as used by legions of scientists and engineers.

* [ANSI Fortran66](http://www.fh-jena.de/~kleine/history/languages/ansi-x3dot9-1966-Fortran66.pdf) and [ Fortran77](http://www.fh-jena.de/~kleine/history/languages/ansi-x3dot9-1978-Fortran77.pdf) standards, obsoleted by the Fortran90 and Fortran95 standards, but still handy for reading legacy code.
