*The "third language" of pseudocode.* "The crux of what has been done in the past has been the introduction of a third language into programming -- the first two being the language of the machine and the language in which the problem is formulated. (The following analogy is illustrated in Fig. 1.) Until very recently programmers have been like an American who can speak German who finds himself with a Frenchman who can speak Russian. In order to communicate with the Frenchman, the American must find a German who can speak Russian. It would be simpler if the American would learn to speak French or the Frenchman English but, of course, the American would rather have the Frenchman learn to speak English than learn French himself. Similarly, programmers would like computers and data-processing machines to understand the language in which their problems are formulated" (57).
