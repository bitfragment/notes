title: Belated materialism

Federica Frabetti, *Software Theory* (Rowman & Littlefield, 2015), 51:

> [N. Katherine] Hayles's call for a "turn to materiality," which has had great relevance in media studies, is in fact quite belated, and [...] such a call actually results from a misreading of the poststructuralist tradition Hayles draws on (but ultimately departs from).

Frabetti, 57:

> ...language itself is material for Derrida; it needs materiality (better: it needs the possibility of "inscription") to function as language.
> 
> This interpretation contrasts with the consolidated (Anglo-American) reception of "poststructuralism" and of Derrida's thought as unaware of the material aspects of culture, society, economics, and politics (according to Derrida's famous statement that "there is nothing outside the text").[^hors-texte] On the contrary, what I want to emphasize here is that textuality and materiality are not opposed. **There is no actual need — as it is often claimed — to "go back to materiality" after the "linguistic turn" in cultural studies, because materiality has always been there.**

[^hors-texte]: Rather, *il n'y a pas de hors-texte*, "there is no outside-text." —BL
