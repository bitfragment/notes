* [[proglang-src-moser_compiler_1954]]: "The A-2 pseudocode is quite flexible. [â€¦] Reversion to machine code is permitted" (21).

* [[proglang-src-brown_automatic_1954]]: "The opponents of translation procedures" objected that this only put more of the burden on the programmer, since in order to check the program for mistakes he would have to "know and use both external *and* languages, which nullifies some of the advantage" provided by the compiler (87).

* [[proglang-src-backus_ibm_1954]]: in order to offset the "small difference" in efficiency of processing between machine language and a pseudocode, "some programming systems permit some operations to be designated in machine language while others which are not machine operations are interpreted as belonging to a nonmachine language" (106).

> The reason they used assembly language in middle of high level code for games is that it's an old-fashioned optimization trick--make the slowest part of the code go faster by writing it in a lower-level language. The premise is that the compiler, for instance of C++, will not make code as fast as your own version in assembly language. Compilers are very good nowadays, so this is often not worth the effort.
