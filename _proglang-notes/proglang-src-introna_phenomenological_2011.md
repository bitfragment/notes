1. Introna writes that what distinguishes phenomenological approaches from others is their characteristic insistence that technology and society "co-constitute each other from the very start," are each  other's condition of possibility.

2. This notion of a constitutive "horizon" or background that "makes the meaningful experience of the foreground possible," Introna writes, is characteristic of phenomenology.

3. In "Die Frage nach der Technik" (published 1954 in *Vorträge und Aufsätze*), Heidegger, Introna points out, imagined this co-constitution as produced by a specifically modern "way of conducting themselves towards the world [...] as something to be ordered and shaped in line with projects," which he called *Ge-stell* or "enframing": viewing the world as already "framed" as a technologically addressed resource.

4. Heidegger, Introna continues, contrasts this modern *Ge-stell* with the ancient Greek *poiesis,* which was also a relationship with *techne* (a much broader term than "technology," encompassing the arts as well as the crafts), but an aesthetic and poetic relationship rather than an "enframing" one.

5. Stiegler's *La technique et le temps,* Introna notes, draws on Heidegger and Derrida as well as the anthropologist Andre Leroi-Gourhan, especially *Le geste et la parole* (Gesture and Speech, 1964--1965) in arguing for the "co-originality" (Introna's term) of the human and the technical.

6. Leroi-Gourhan, Introna suggests, understood the human use of tools as a unique (among mammals) "exteriorization" of abilities that is simultaneously an interiorization of the relationship with the tools exteriorizing those abilities, and imagined this as an extra-genetic process in which "evolution is transferred from the zoological domain to the technical domain."

7. Stiegler's word for this is "epiphylogenesis," Introna notes, and he describes it as an "inorganic organization of memory" (Stiegler's phrase).

8. It is only through epiphylogenesis, Stiegler suggests in Introna's paraphrase, that we experience time as divided into past, present, and future. "Thus, for Stiegler," Introna concludes, "the constitutive transcendental horizon of the human is technicity, from which emerges the conditions of possibility of time, society and culture."
