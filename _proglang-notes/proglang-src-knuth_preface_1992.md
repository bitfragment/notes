* "At first, I thought programming was primarily analogous to musical composition â€” to the creation of intricate patterns, which are meant to be performed. But lately I have come to realize that a far better analogy is available: Programming is best regarded as the process of creating *works of literature*, which are meant to be read" [@knuth_preface_1992, ix].

* "Literature of the program genre is performable by machines, but that is not its main purpose. The computer programs that are truly beautiful, useful, and profitable must be readable by people. So we ought to address them to people, not to machines" [@knuth_preface_1992, ix].
