* *Universities reluctant to train programmers.* Picking up where Hopper 1954 had left off in her comments on a "universal pseudocode," Gorn 1954 observed that despite the investment in computer design, construction, and use for data processing at universities, "universities are reluctant to train programmers, feeling that there are too many specialized codes. Perhaps this reluctance will vanish if we can provide a code more or less independent of the machine" (75).

* *Requirements for a "universal code."* Gorn 1954 described some requirements for a "universal code" or "universal coding" and "the machines capable of translating it" (75). The first requirement is translatability: "it must be translatable by the machine into the machine language" (75). The second requirement is relative or "floating" addressing, to leave to an assembler the assignment of final addresses (36).

* *"Translation" vs. assembly.* Gorn 1954 distinguished "translation" of universal code into machine code from assembly, which "transforms from universal code to universal code and involves no reference to machine coding" (81).
