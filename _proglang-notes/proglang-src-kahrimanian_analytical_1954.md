*What drives development of automatic coding systems.* "In the past, the development of numerical techniques by mathematicians and their application to a wide variety of problems provided a large part of the initial impetus for the development of digital computers. Today, the existence of many large-scale electronic digital computers and their ever-increasing number of applications to problems of all kinds has necessitated the growth of automatic programming systems. Coding specific instances of a class of problems has been proved to be an onerous and time-consuming task." (6)
