> Categorisation of Computer Programming Languages
> ------------------------------------------------
>
> To study computer programming languages it is convenient to devide such languages into categories according to some classification. Many classifications have been suggested. The most popular are listed below:
>
> Classification according to levels of abstraction:
>
> 1. Machine code
> 2. Low level languages, e.g. assemler.
> 3. High level languages, e.g. Ada, C, PROLOG.
>
> Classification according to generations of programming languages:
>
> 1. 1st Generation languages (circa 1950): Low level languages e.g. assembler.
> 2. 2nd Generation languages (late 1950's to early 1960's): Foundation languages, e.g. ALGOL-60, Cobol, Fortran.
> 3. 3rd Generation languages (late 1960's onwards): Structured languages, e,g. Ada, C, Prolog.
> 4. 4th Generation languages (circa 1980 onwards): 4GLs, e.g. SQL.
>
> Classification according to application area. Most current programming languages are categorised as 3rd generation. This category is therefore sometimes divided into two sub categories:
>
> 1. General purpose high order languages, e.g. ALGOL, Pascal, Ada and C.
> 2. Specialised languages designed to exploit alternative paradigms, e.g. Smalltalk, declarative languages.
>
> Declarative languages are considered to be specialised in that they were initially intended for use in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and expert systems programming. Example decalarative languages include: PROLOG, LISP, Miranda, Haskell and SML.
