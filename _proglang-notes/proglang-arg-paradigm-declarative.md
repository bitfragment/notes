title: "Paradigm: declarative"
---

As a "paradigm," declarative programming describes relationships between variables, and thereby describes a logic or a computation to be performed — but, unlike imperative programming, does not describe a sequence of operations (control flow). At the level of description, operations are order independent.

Regular expressions and markup formats are declarative in character, in this sense.

> Back in the 1980′s [*sic*] it was very fashionable to talk about “declarative” programming languages. But to my mind there was never a clear definition of a “declarative language”, and hence no way to tell what is declarative and what is not. Lacking any clear meaning, the term came to refer to the arbitrary conflation of functional with logic programming to such an extent that “functional-and-logic-programming” almost became a Germanic thing-in-itself (ding an sich).  Later, as the logic programming wave subsided, the term “declarative”,  like “object-oriented”, came to be an expression of approval, and then, mercifully, died out.
