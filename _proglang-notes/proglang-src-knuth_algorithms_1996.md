Algorithm and program
---------------------

* An *algorithm* is an abstract computational method and thus exists "apart from any programming language" [@knuth_algorithms_1996, 1].

* A *program* is a representation and a concrete "embodiment" of an algorithm in a particular language [@knuth_algorithms_1996, 1; @knuth_algorithms_1996, 2].


Literate programming
--------------------

"A programmer is ideally an essayist who works with traditional aesthetic and literary forms as well as mathematical concepts, to communicate the way that an algorithm works and to convince a reader that the results will be correct" [@knuth_algorithms_1996, 2].
