* On assignment expressions: "[T]he systematic use of assignments constitutes a distinct break between computer-science thinking and mathematical thinking" [@knuth_early_2003, 12]. The flow diagrams described by Goldstine and von Neumann in *Planning and Coding of Problems for an Electronic Computing Instrument* (1947-48) "represent a transition point between the mathematical 'equality' notation and the computer-science 'assignment' operation" [@knuth_early_2003, 14].
