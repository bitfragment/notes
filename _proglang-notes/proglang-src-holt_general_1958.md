## Translation in compilation

"In point of broad classification, the automatic programming system developed by the UNIVAC Applications Research Center is a compiler. This means that it shares two important characteristics with other systems similarly classified. First, complete solution of a problem with the aid of the system involves two computer steps: (1) translation of an encoding of the problem (in a special form associated with the system) into a computer-coded routine, and (2) actual problem computation. The second characteristic common to all compilers is that during the translating process, reference is made to a collection of packages of information, usually called library subroutines, which contribute in some way to the final result." (8)

"In any event, the special notations which represent the sine computation may be viewed as a special encoding of the sine function which must be translated into computer code before the program may function. Such translation is normally accomplished by reference to a so-called library subroutine, introduced by a compiler at the point at which the special notations were originally written." (8)
